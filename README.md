Machine Learning: Model Validation

In this project, I understood the implications of hold out;
I applied cross validation techniques;
I used randomness to my advantage;
I understood when to use several different cross-validation strategies: KFold, StratifiedKFold, GroupKFold;
I worked on predicting new groups when not all data are independent readings from each other;
I used a pipeline for training and validation.
